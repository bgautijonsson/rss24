## Overview

This website contains materials for my RSSConf24 talk on applying Gaussian Markov Random Field (GMRF) copulas to model data-level spatial dependence in multivariate Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distributions. The talk is [scheduled between 09:00 - 10:00 on Thursday](https://virtual.oxfordabstracts.com/#/event/6693/program?session=92696&s=0){target="_blank"}
