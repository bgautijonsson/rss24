## Welcome

This is the landing page for the GitHub repository on my RSSConf24 talk. Here, I explore the application of Gaussian Markov Random Field (GMRF) copulas to model data-level spatial dependence in multivariate Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distributions.

## Project Overview

Our research focuses on:

1. Modeling spatial dependence in extreme values
2. Combining GEV distributions with GMRF copulas
3. Efficient computational techniques for large spatial fields

## Key Components

### Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) Distributions

We use GEV distributions to model extreme events, particularly in the context of spatial data.

### Gaussian Markov Random Fields (GMRFs)

GMRFs provide a powerful framework for capturing spatial dependence, offering both modeling flexibility and computational efficiency.

### GMRF Copulas

We construct copulas based on GMRFs to model data-level dependence in multivariate GEV distributions.
